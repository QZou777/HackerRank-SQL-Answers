# HackerRank-SQL-Answers

This repository contains answers for SQL practice questions from HackerRank. All the code are produced by author (me) himself. They might not be the most elegant solutions so I am happy to learn the better alternatives as well. Most of the solutions can be applied in MS SQL Server Management Studio, while some of the files that can be applied to both MySQL and MS SQL SMS or MySQL only.
